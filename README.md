I consider myself to be a combination of a user and a programmer, and I try to bridge that gap by making useful, well-documented tools or by writing documentation for tools that other people have authored. With that being said, I'm early in my career and I am learning every day. If you have any suggestions for making what I write clearer, please feel free to open a PR. I am also hoping to learn more about efficiency in my code, especially in Python.

If you need to contact me about work-related things, the best way to reach me is on Slack.

I tend to add the following tags to my commits when developing, especially in repos where I don't yet have Travis set up yet. It's in reference to my internal tests, which can change during development. These are notes to myself and not really useful to a user, but if you were wondering...
[ff] Fully functional
[nf] Not functional
[sf] Sorta functional
[ut] Untested
